This is the state of the assessment after 3 hours.

## Instructions

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to run the app locally.

## Overview

While I was able to accomplish the assignment features as a minimum level, I wasn't able to polish any of them or add on extra features before I ran out of time.

#### Mistake in reviewing assignment

Although I was instructed to ask any questions I had before starting the assignment, upon starting, I realized that I had not examined the data API carefully enough. I had a couple of questions regarding the requirements; however, because I did not ask them until after I had started, I did not give enough time to have them answered.

The result of this is that where the instructions mention the "ship name" the device make/model/platform is used instead. Also, sorting logic is based on the year.

#### Next steps

If I were going to continue on this project, I would focus on the following features and improvements:

1. Performance of the table - filtering has some significant performance deficits likely due to a naive implementation of the filtering and sorting logic.
2. Finish map implementation - I had a cool map feature that I started but did not have time to fully implement (more work into examining the coordinates given in the API is needed).
3. Table enrichment - More fields could be added to the table itself. Additional UI features like country flags, refresh buttons, and URL links could also be added.
